# Accordion component

## Requirements:

Create a reusable Accordion component that abstracts common elements and features from the provided list of example accordions. Focus on creating a component that is consistent, simple, and clean following best UX/UI practices.

1. Implement the component without relying on libraries like Tailwind or Material-UI for styling. Use basic CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components.
1. The Accordion should be responsive and work across different browser sizes.
1. The Accordion must meet WCAG accessibility guidelines
1. Provide any workings, such as sketches, flowcharts, or notes, that you created to
   help with the abstraction process.
